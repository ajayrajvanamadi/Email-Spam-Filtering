# Email-Spam-Filtering
Email spam filtering using naive bayesian classification. 
1.	Used Python for our project, so you can run the project if you have python workspace.
2.	The submitted folder has two files spam_classifier.py, spam_classifier_pickle.py. 
3.	Run spam_classifier.py and use the sample emails (email1, email2) in the same folder while you run the code, or else you can use any email from your inbox/spam folder can be taken in the form of text file that should be in the same folder.
